Directory with the projects of Udacity Sensor fusion Nanodegree.

## 1. LiDAR Obstacle Detection

There are two codes compiled after make: ./environment and ./main_env

I created ./main_env because I tried to make something clean and straight to the point. You can run it. It's working perfectly.

Due to short time, i didn't finish main_processPcl.cpp, which is my new version of processPointCloud.cpp, and must confess that I didn't understand 
perfectly about what was expected related to RANSAC and Euclidean Clustering. So, I did what I believe is correct, and anything that you see that is 
incorrect, please notify me.


## 2. Camera

Soon.

## 3. Radar

Soon.

## 4. Kalman Filters

Soon.
